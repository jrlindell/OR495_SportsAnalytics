OR 495 (Sports Analytics) class from USAFA taken Junior year


Example files: things worked on in class to understand the nuiances of sports analytics

Final Project: goal was to  predict NHL players points totals for the playoffs based on their regular season stats, 
the expected goals for and against, and the team matchups. 
  The goal was to predict players' points totals at the end of the playoffs
    The more games a player plays, the more opportunities they have to score
       Every series was evaluated based on teams' expected points for and against and series games was predicted
        The series games were important because if the player went to 2 series but won both in 4 games, they will have less
        scoring opportunities than a different player than played two series and both went to 7 games. 
        
        
Did not check accuracy after playoffs were completed
